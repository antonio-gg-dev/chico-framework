# Chico Framework

## Archived

This project has been archived since its functionalities have been absorbed by
[Gacela Project](https://github.com/gacela-project), specifically by its
[Router module](https://github.com/gacela-project/router).

I am actively participating in this project so there is no point in maintaining two projects that pursue similar goals.

Of course, Gacela has active support and new features and improvements are being continuously added. I can only
recommend reading its documentation and venturing to use it.

## About

Chico is a micro framework oriented to offer the minimum viable product to start a Web/API project.

I'm creating Chico mainly to use it as a base in my own projects, where due to various practices and methodologies
that I follow I prefer to attach the minimum to any piece of software that is not part of the project itself.

Other frameworks which I have worked with, such as Laravel or Symfony, tend to mark your entire project with its
essence, influencing its architecture and adding its limitations.

I also want to get out of my comfort zone, there are many things a programmer should be able to do but have never done.
This is so in my case and I want to put myself to the test.

## The name

I was looking for a word that refers to the main objective of my framework, which is to be small and light. Words that
refer to small sizes, like yocto, zepto, pico, nano, micro... are taken by hundreds of projects.

So I opted to use the word *chico* (from Spanish), what does it mean?

In Spain the main use of *chico* is to refer to a boy. In some places it's used to refer to little things too. The word
amuses me and belongs to my land, so I decided to use it.

## Roadmap and Features

What I usually look in a framework are mainly these things and this is my progress:

- [x] Router
- [ ] Dependency Resolver
- [ ] Boilerplate
